# Task Manager

This web site is a task manager that with data from [Json place holder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

I also used MUI for the UI

In this site you can do CRUD operations, search and add users, add todo's and posts, and when you mark all users todo's as completed, the border of the user will be green.
